        This document describe the planned journey of this library, as a new project, I am starting
        with the essentials and gradually expanding to create a complete toolkit for modern web
        interfaces. This roadmap will evolve as I progress and incorporate feedback

        Why this library
      </PNav.Link>
      <p>
        I have been using Qwik for a while and I used or explored a few libraries while using it,
        the most proeminent one being <a href="https://qwikui.com/">qwikui</a>. In my projects I
        amassed a large amount of components or utility, but it was always quite messy to
        orchestrate them and moving them around, there was no unified way to share them accross
        projects, and rather than create a close sourced library for my own pleasure I decided to
        open up this project.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently my sole goal is to release it with a few dozen styled and accessible components
        following the styles from moon.io but also leveraging the works from qwikui, shadcn and by
        extension radix-ui.
